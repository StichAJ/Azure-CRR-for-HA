# üåê Azure Cross-Region Replication for High Availability with Lifecycle Configuration

## üìò Overview
This project outlines a strategic approach to implementing **cross-region replication** in Microsoft Azure. The goal is to maximize **high availability (HA)** and optimize storage costs through **lifecycle management policies**, while ensuring compliance and business continuity.

> üî∞ *Note: This is my first Azure architecture project. It‚Äôs part of my learning journey, and I welcome feedback and collaboration!*

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Summary

The architecture is designed to:
- Ensure **business continuity** across Azure paired regions
- Enable **disaster recovery** using native Azure services
- Provide **cost-efficient storage** through automated data lifecycle transitions
- Support **secure, compliant infrastructure** for sensitive workloads

## üîß Core Azure Services

- **Azure Storage Account**  
  Supports Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS), Read-Access GRS (RA-GRS), and Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS) for cross-region data durability.

- **Lifecycle Management**  
  Automates transitions of blob data between Hot, Cool, and Archive tiers based on access patterns.

- **Azure SQL Database**  
  Uses active geo-replication to maintain a synchronized secondary database in another region.

- **Azure Cosmos DB**  
  Enables multi-region writes and automatic failover for globally distributed workloads.

- **Azure Site Recovery**  
  Protects virtual machines by replicating them across different regions.

- **Azure Virtual Machines**  
  Compute workloads maintained with built-in redundancy and recovery features.

- **Azure Key Vault**  
  Secrets, certificates, and keys are protected with region-paired redundancy.

- **Azure Traffic Manager**  
  Global DNS-based traffic routing for regional load balancing and failover.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Overview

1. **Deploy storage with GRS or RA-GRS settings** to enable geo-replication.
2. **Create lifecycle management rules** to automate data movement across storage tiers.
3. **Set up geo-replication** for Azure SQL and Cosmos DB to ensure failover readiness.
4. **Enable Azure Site Recovery** for VM workloads in critical environments.
5. **Use Azure Traffic Manager** to route user traffic intelligently based on availability.
6. **Secure resources** with region-paired Azure Key Vault and RBAC.

## ‚úÖ Benefits

- **Resilience:** Data and services remain available during regional failures.
- **Efficiency:** Reduced storage costs with automated data tiering.
- **Security:** Role-based access, encryption, and region-pairing support compliance needs.
- **Scalability:** Multi-region architecture supports enterprise-level workloads.

## üìå Next Steps

- Add architectural diagram and visuals
- Include Terraform or Bicep templates (future update)
- Expand documentation with setup examples and monitoring practices
